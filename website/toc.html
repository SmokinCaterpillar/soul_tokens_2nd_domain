        <h1>Terms and Conditions ("Terms") aka some legal Mumbo Jumbo</h1>
        <p>Last updated: 19th of October, 2017</p>

        <p>
            Please, read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully (haha, do you?)
            before using the www.soulnapkins.com website (the "Service") operated by Charon's team ("us", "we", or "our").

            Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.
            These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

            By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms.
            If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.

            While using our Services or website you must be at least 18 years old (or the age of contractual capacity)
            and you confirm that you are eligible to do so and not restricted legally,
            based on your residency, geographic location, or other eligibility criteria
            (remember what the sell soul button says, eh?).
        </p>
        <h2> Services We Offer</h2>
        <p>
            We guarantee or offer anything whatsoever. All Ether or Bitcoin send to our contract
            won't necessarily give you anything in return (sorry we cannot make any guarantees)
            and happens voluntarily. Maybe you are even better off flushing it down the tubes!

            Moreover, the website and the Ethereum smart contract come "AS IS" and without any warranty.
            You are free to check the smart contract yourself since the source code is freely available (see FAQs).
            Again, sending Ether to our contract does not entitle you to anyhting except saying good-bye to it!
        </p>
        <h2>Content Submitted to the Blockchain</h2>
        <p>
            We are by no means responsible for the content you publish on the Blockchain.
            We do not host or store your comments on our website or our webserver. Your submission
            is stored in a massively decentralized manner on the Ethereum Blockchain and beyond
            our or anyone's control. Your submission cannot be deleted.
            You are solely responsible for the content you upload to the Blockchain.

            You may only upload content that you own, have created, or that you have clear permission to publish.
            You acknowledge and agree that we do not endorse any user content and are not responsible or liable for any such content submitted to the Blockchain,
            even though it may be unlawful, harassing, libelous, privacy-invading, abusive, threatening, harmful, vulgar, obscene, or otherwise objectionable,
            or may infringe upon the intellectual property or other rights of another.

            Although your submissions cannot be deleted, we reserve the right to no display extremely offensive or racist submissions made to the
            Blockchain on our website.
        </p>
        <h2>Links To Other Websites</h2>
        <p>
            Our website may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by us.

            We have no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies,
            or practices of any third party websites or services. You further acknowledge and
            agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly,
            for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of
            or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such websites or services.

            We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party
            websites or services that you visit.
        </p>
        <h2>U.S. and Chinese Citizens</h2>
        <p>
            By using our services you confirm that you are not a citizen, resident, or entity of the United States or China,
            nor are you purchasing or signing on behalf of a Chinese or U.S. citizen, resident, or entity.
            Not that the Chinese or Americans have no souls (maybe Trump not, but I digress),
            but ICOs have a hard time in these countries and Charon
            wants to stay out of legal shenanigans over there.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>

        <p>
            We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

            By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using our website and contracts.
